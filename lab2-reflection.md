# Lab 2 Reflection
## Compare Bash with Java
I was successful in recreating my original Java LabDueDates program's features using bash. The similarities between bash script and Java was that they both allow for functions and variables. A difference between bash script and Java is that variables in bash do not have a type, whereas in Java, variables are statically typed. For my Java program, I need to import several libaries such that it could know the current date, futures dates, and the difference between dates. In my bash script, I used the date and expr command.

## Sample Run for Shell script and Make
Since my Java program required file redirection for user input, I found it more difficult to get a file name as a parameter using make. Something that was similar is that you are able to breakdown the steps into smaller parts. In shell script you can define functions and in make you can define rules.
